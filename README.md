## **Suggestions**
1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
   
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort than the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
 
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonableamount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
  
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal toreduce the cancellation rate.
